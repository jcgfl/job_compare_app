## 2 Process Description

### 2.1. Requirements engineering

**Goal:** Understand the problem space, users and their goals.

**Exit criteria:** Enough coverage of main processes and use cases.

Input:

- Conversation with prospective clients and internal users
- Documentation of existing processes
- Observation of current tools and systems

Output:

- Identify the purpose of the system
- Well documented set of requirements
- Concise and actionable set of activities
- Use case diagram


### 2.2. Design

**Goal:** Transform software requirements into system specifications.

**Exit criteria:** Documented specifications are enough to unblock implementation.

Input:

- Requirements engineering documentation
- Use case diagram

Output:

- System and engineering requirements
- Architectural design
- Abstract specification
- Interface design
- Component design
- Data structure
- Algorithm design
- System structure
- Software specification
- Interface specification
- Component specification
- Data structure specification
- Algorithm specification


### 2.3. Implementation

**Goal:** Transform the design into actual, usable software.

**Exit criteria:** Software coding is completed and meets all specifications and requirements.

Input:

- System structure
- Software specification
- Interface specification
- Component specification
- Data structure specification
- Algorithm specification

Output:

- Complete source code of the application
- Working executable compatible with the target platform
- GUI covering all use cases
- Coding following expected client's standards
- Validated code structure
- Deployment settings covering potential diversity of platforms
- Reduced algorithm complexity whenever possible


### 2.4. Verification and validation

**Goal:** Ensure that the implementation software meets all required specifications.

**Exit criteria:** All user cases are correctly implemented and ready for end-user onboarding.

Input:

- Compiled software
- Deployment instructions
- Documentation, including design and specifications

Output:

- Unit level test plan and execution
- Integration test plan and execution
- System level test plan and execution
- User manual updated and ready for publication

### 2.5. Maintenance

**Goal:** Ensure continued operation and alignment to client's evolving requirements.

**Exit criteria:** This is an ongoing process that will remain active while the software is supported and in use.

Input:

- Bug report
- Feature request
- Environment change report

Output

- Bug fixes
- Prioritized list of features
- Roadmap of new features
- Support for environment changes
- Documentation of changes history
- Corrective/perfective/adaptive maintenance
